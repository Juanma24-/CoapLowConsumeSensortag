## CoapLowConsumeSensortag
Developing of multicast coap over Contiki adding very low consuming characteristics on Sensortag 2.0 (cc2650)

An effort for developing an app joining Coap and Rest engine with Ipv6 multicasting. The two funcionalities are developed in
Contiki's examples, however, due to the kind of application I want to develop I need to join the two examples in one adding all
necesary to work properly.
This project has been developed under Contiki 3.x. It seems that for Sensortag there is no problem using the most recent version of contiki however it does not happened the same in gateway. Due to this incompatibility a stable will be released with the app. In the wiki, everything will be explained widely.
