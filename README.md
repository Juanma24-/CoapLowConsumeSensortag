# CoapLowConsumeSensortag
Developing of multicast coap over Contiki adding very low consuming characteristics on Sensortag 2.0 (cc2650)

An effort for developing an app joining Coap and Rest engine with Ipv6 multicasting. The two funcionalities are developed in
Contiki's examples, however, due to the kind of application I want to develop I need to join the two examples in one adding all
necesary to work properly. :)
